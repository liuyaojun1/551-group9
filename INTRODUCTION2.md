# Milestone 2 Submission Introduction

## App Name
**Missed Appointment Tracker**

## Overview
The **Missed Appointment Tracker** is an interactive dashboard designed to help users explore patterns related to missed medical appointments (e.g., *missed* vs *present*). The app supports visual comparison of appointment status across multiple variables such as **date**, **age**, **gender**, and **physical disability**.

This project aims to make it easier to identify trends and potential risk factors associated with missed appointments through an intuitive and interactive visualization interface.

## Problem Statement
Missed appointments can create operational inefficiencies in healthcare systems, increase wait times, and reduce access to care for other patients. However, the factors associated with missed appointments are often distributed across multiple demographic and scheduling variables, which can be difficult to interpret using raw tables alone.

Our app addresses this challenge by providing a dashboard that:
- compares the distribution of **Missed** vs **Present** appointments,
- supports filtering and sorting of variables,
- allows users to visually inspect patterns across different feature types.

## Target Audience
This dashboard is intended for:
- **Healthcare administrators**
- **Clinic operations staff**
- **Analysts / researchers**
- **Students learning exploratory data analysis and dashboard design**

These users can use the app to quickly explore which variables may be associated with higher no-show rates.

## Milestone 2 Scope (Prototype)
In Milestone 2, we focus on building a **functional prototype** that demonstrates the core dashboard workflow and interaction design. The current version includes:

- A **sidebar control panel** for user interaction
- A **variable filter** (e.g., variable type / variable selection)
- A **date filter** (calendar/date range selection)
- **Sorting options** (e.g., by variable name or probability/show-related metric)
- A **main visualization area** displaying distributions of different variables
- Consistent color encoding and a **legend** for appointment status:
  - **Red** = Missed
  - **Blue** = Present
- Basic **tooltips** for interactive exploration

## Key Features Implemented in Milestone 2
- Interactive filtering controls
- Multiple chart panels for variable distributions
- Comparison of appointment status categories
- Dashboard layout with sidebar + main panel structure
- Initial visual design aligned with the project sketch/wireframe

## What Is Planned for Future Milestones
In future milestones, we plan to improve:
- usability and layout polish,
- responsiveness and performance,
- richer interactivity (e.g., brushing/linking if applicable),
- user feedback integration,
- documentation and final deployment presentation.

## Team Notes
This Milestone 2 submission represents the prototype stage of the project. The goal is to demonstrate the core analytical workflow and major interactions, rather than a fully polished final product.
