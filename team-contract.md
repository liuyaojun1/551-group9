# Team Work Contract (Flight–Animal Impacts Dashboard)

- **Work Distribution:** Work will be distributed equally among all team members, and we will rebalance tasks if someone is overloaded or blocked.
- **Project Duration:** The expected project duration is **Feb 10, 2026 – Mar 20, 2026**, and we will plan milestones within this window.
- **Meeting Frequency:** The group will meet **2–3 times per week**, with additional check-ins only if needed.
- **Meeting Structure:** We will not use formal meeting agendas, but meetings will focus on progress updates, blockers, and next steps.
- **Working Style:** We work primarily individually on assigned tasks, then merge contributions and discuss together when problems or inconsistencies arise.
- **Quality Expectations:** Each member is expected to deliver high-quality results, including clear documentation and reproducible work.
- **Availability:** Team members are generally not available during evenings and weekends, so we will keep most coordination within weekday daytime hours.
